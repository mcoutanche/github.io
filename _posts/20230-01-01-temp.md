Step 2: Install AutoGen
Open your terminal and run:

```shell
pip install pyautogen
```
> 💡 AutoGen makes it easy to create multi‑agent systems with tools, memory, and planning.

Step 3: Create Your First Agent
Create a file called simple_agent.py:

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent

assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="HelperAgent",
    system_message="You are a helpful AI agent that provides clear, simple explanations."
)

question = "How does solar power work?"
response = assistant.run(question)

print(response)
``
```
This basic agent:

Loads a model
Receives a user question
Responds with helpful reasoning

Run it:
```shell
python simple_agent.py
```

You’ve just run your first AI Agent!

#### Welcome to the new home of TechKB.onl!

If you've stumbled across this post, **welcome!** Whether you’ve followed my work before or just landed here by accident (thanks, search engine magic), I’m glad you’re here.

Some of you might remember my old blog, which was hosted on a Wordpress site, where I shared bits and pieces from my journey through the Microsoft tech stack. It’s been a while since I posted anything there, life, work, and the occasional blog platform meltdown got in the way. But now, I’m back with a fresh space now hosted in GitHub pages, a better setup for the site, and a renewed focus.

This **NEW** blog is all about Microsoft Cloud, Data and AI and the wider ecosystem of technologies that have shaped my career, from the NT4 days (yes, really) through Hyper-V, RDP, domain services, and now deep into cloud. I’m currently working as an Azure Practice Lead at Cloud Direct, a UK-based Microsoft partner, and I’ve had the privilege of helping businesses modernise, scale, and thrive using Microsofts ever-evolving cloud capabilities.

#### What to expect here:

* Bi-weekly posts (that’s the plan!) diving into technical Cloud, Data and AI topics, real-world scenarios, and lessons learned
* Reflections from my journey
* Occasional throwbacks as I migrate content from my old blog, some of it might even still hold up!

Whether you're just starting out with Microsoft's Cloud technologies or you're neck-deep in designing enterprise-grade solutions, I hope this blog becomes a space where we can learn, share, and maybe even debate a little.

Thanks for stopping by—and if you’ve got questions, ideas, or just want to say hello, drop a comment or connect with me. Let’s make this a conversation, not just a monologue.

Here’s to the next chapter!

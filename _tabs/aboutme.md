Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the chance to work closely with Microsoft in a few different roles, one of the highlights was serving as a P-TSP (Partner Technical Solutions Professional) for Azure. More recently, I was invited to join the Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Partner Advisory Council (PAC), which has been a great opportunity to help shape the future of Azure alongside other global experts.
